The purpose of this project was to make a small web project to learn Nuxt, its ecosystem, and Bulma with Buefy.

After discovering and enjoying Gridsome, I wanted to dig deeper in the Vue.js world, and to learn its well-known Nuxt framework.
As far as I went, i really enjoyed the journey, and I consider making vue.js my main frontend framework.
It was the opportunity to discover tools like prettier or eslint, which I wasn't used to go with.

This fully static app can easily be deployed to any web server with ease, thanks to the Nuxt static generation feature

For the visual layer of this app, I chose to go with Bulma, and its vueJS integration which is Buefy, to get some widgets up and ready,
and a quick way to implement a clean and responsive UI.

I first started by implementing the layout I was looking for. Then I implemented the navigation, I installed and configured the needed dependencies, and then I implemented the security layer through the Nuxt-auth and Nuxt-axios pluggin.

For the back-end of this project, I chose to use Strapi, which is a very popular nodejs CMS that allow to quickly bootsrap a full-featured API.
this back-end is based on a docker container cluster which i can easily deploy on any server. 
I plan to keep working on it as the time goes.
