The purpose of this application is to attract new customers to a business.

It works as a digital loyalty card. Connecting to the user CRM in order to analyse data and send code by SMS to customers reaching milestone in a salon.

The user can create and customize multiple campaigns, with a customized message and a visit threshold.

When the customer reaches a threshold, he received the SMS with a code giving him a reduction on his next visit, and giving him the opportunity to invite someone for free.
