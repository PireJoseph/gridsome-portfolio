Design, conception, development and realization of a connected power strip aimed at reducing electricity consumption in households.

This school project was built by a team of EPHEC students, in partnership with the Young Enterprise Project (YEP).
I have been in charge of handling the server holding the data and building the user interface. 

It integrates many technologies like electronics, networking, signal processing, and web development.

In order to accomplish this purpose, I used vanilla PHP with MYSQL on the server, and HTML, CSS, JS and jQueryUI to build the interface.

This project has been awarded at the school level, and the team invited to represent EPHEC at the next part of the context.
