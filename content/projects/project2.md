The purpose of this project was to build a software able to collect and process data from a domestic water meter.

This project was build in collaboration with other students from EPHEC, in order to propose a solution to help peoples track and manage their water consumption.

We used our skill and understanding acquired from the signal processing course (matrix calculation, convolution, ...) combined with our software development abilities.
