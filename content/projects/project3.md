The purpose of this end study work was to build a large web application with the latest web technologies in PHP and JavaScript.

The idea started from a will to promote sport activities within students of EPHEC and to learn new web building tools.

This project consists of an API REST build with API Platform, on top on Symfony, consumed by a single page application powered by VueJs and W3.CSS.
This platform also had an independent admin interface allowing to manage and provide the content to the end users.

I tried to integrate and apply all my knowledge and skill acquired during my school trip at EPHEC and my internship Keyros S.A., in various domain like project management, business analysis, law class, web development, etc...
