Configuration and deployment of a network infrastructure on top of docker.

With a team of other students we have deployed different service for a virtual corporation.

Those service (mail, ftp, web, VOIP, firewall,...) were deployed on a Virtual Private Server hosted by OVH, on a cluster of dedicated container orchestrated by Docker.
