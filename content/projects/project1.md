From an idea of building a tool to help to learn vocabulary of a new language, i have developed an MVC application from scratch.

The Purpose of this project was to apply what I learned from my java lecture.

My technical challenge was to build a small MVC project with a graphical and a console GUI, connected to a Mysql database with JDBC.

I started by designing the model and the visual of the different interfaces. 
Then I have implemented the model, and the console view, driven by a dedicated controller.

After the model, I developed the first view layer in the CLI. The application was listening to user inputs, with different prompt indicating the available commands to modify the model or navigate between each section of the application.

I finished by implementing the graphical view with the old swing library. This GUI was synchronized with the CLI in order to replicate the actions made from the GUI to the CLI and vice-versa.
