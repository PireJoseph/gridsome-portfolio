From an idea of building a tool to help to learn vocabulary of a new language, i have developed an MVC application from scratch.

The Purpose of this project was to apply what I learned from my java lecture.

My technical challenge was to build a small MVC project with a graphical and a console GUI, connected to a Mysql database with JDBC.

I started by designing the model and the visual of the different interfaces. 
Then I have implemented the model and the console view, driven by a dedicated controller.
I finished by implementing the graphical view with the old swing library.
