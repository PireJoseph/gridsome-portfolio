The purpose of this project was to learn the Jamstack and to improve myself in front-end development.

I discovered the Jamstack at my last job for Utopix pictures through GatsbyJS.
 
When I was convicted by the benefits of its approach (high performance, easier scaling, higher security, better developer experience,...)
I wanted to challenge myself, and go on my own building something with it. As I was looking for a new job, I decided to make my portfolio.

In order to accomplish this task, I had to pick a static site generator and a CMS. To make a choice between all the tech available, 
I used two sites which I recommend: _[StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/)_ and _[HeadlessCMS](https://headlesscms.org/)_.

For the SSG part, I decided to chose Gridsome, which is based on GatsbyJS, but for vueJS, which i highly prefer over react.

For the CMS part, I decided to use NetlifyCMS, as it was highly recommended and easy to pick up.

To build the design of this project, I ve chosen to pick tailwindcss due to its popularity, its low level approach and its ability to get highly customizable.

To begin this project I used a _[starter](https://gridsome.org/starters/gridsome-casper-v3-starter/)_ to get introduced to the new techs I was going to use, and to understand how to structure my project. and how to 
Little by little, I customized it to fit my own need, and to implement my vision of my portfolio.

I used this project like a sandbox to try few things and techniques, and I plan to keep working on it as the time goes.
