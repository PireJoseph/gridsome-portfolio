It is based on Vue.js official libraries (vue, vue-router and vuex) and powerful development tools (webpack, Babel and PostCSS).
  
Nuxt's goal is to make web development powerful and performant with a great developer experience in mind.

Nuxt is a framework designed to give you a strong architecture following official Vue guidelines. Incrementally adoptable, it can be used to create everything from static landing pages to complex enterprise ready web applications.

Versatile by nature, it supports different targets (server, serverless or static) and server side rendering is switchable.

Extendable with a strong module ecosystem, it makes it easy to connect your REST or GraphQL endpoints, favorite CMS, CSS frameworks and more. PWA and AMP support is only a module away from your Nuxt project.

NuxtJS is the backbone of your Vue.js project, giving structure to build your project with confidence while being flexible.
