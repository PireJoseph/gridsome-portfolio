Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

Instead of predesigned components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
