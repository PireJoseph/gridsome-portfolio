**Gridsome is a Jamstack framework**. Jamstack lets you build fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.



Gridsome **generates static html** that hydrates into a **Vue SPA** once loaded in the browser. This means you can build both **static websites** & **dynamic apps** with Gridsome.
