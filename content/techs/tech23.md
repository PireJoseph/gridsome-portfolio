MATLABÂ® combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and design processes with a programming language that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly.

It includes the Live Editor for creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook.

MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.
