API Platform is a powerful but easy to use full stack framework dedicated to API-driven projects.

It contains a PHP library to create fully featured APIs supporting industry-leading standards (JSON-LD and Hydra, GraphQL, OpenAPI...),
provides ambitious JavaScript tooling to consume those APIs in a snap (admin, PWA and mobile app generators, hypermedia client...)
and is shipped with a nice Docker and Kubernetes integration to develop and deploy instantly on the cloud.
