Starting from raw specification, I have made an analysis of the requirements, in order to conceptualize a model
which I translated to UML use case diagram.

From this use case diagram I have implemented the model in entity classes in the Symfony Framework.
I implemented the business logic and the business specifications in a dedicated application layer in order to 
built the API which would be consumed later buy the differents interfaces of the applications.

I used the tools (metronic bootrap) to built those interfaces to fit with the other modules in a  responsive design. 

Finaly, i have developed the functionnal tests to cover this codebase, before deploying on a virtualized server.
