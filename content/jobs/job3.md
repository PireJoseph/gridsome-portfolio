Starting from raw specification, I have made an analysis of the requirements, in order to conceptualize a model
which I translated to UML use case diagram.

From this use case diagram I have implemented the model in entity classes in the Symfony Framework.
I implemented the business logic, and the business specifications in a dedicated application layer in order to 
build the API which would be consumed later buy the different interfaces of the applications.

I used the tools (Metronic Bootstrap) to build those interfaces to fit with the other modules in a responsive design. 

Finally, I have developed the functional tests to cover this codebase, before deploying on a virtualized server.
