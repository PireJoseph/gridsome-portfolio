###### Electricity
Electricity and magnetism; induction, flux, transformation, AC & DC, RC and LRC circuits,... applications in telecommunication

###### Electronic
Digital and analog signals characteristics, logic gates, boolean algebra, basic circuits(adder, comparator, decoder, multiplexers, parity control, registers, flip-flops...), 
Digital conversion, microcontroller PIC. Design and simulation of circuits.

###### Signal processing
Analog: Signal representation, Fourier transformations, transmissions systems, filters(time, frequency, signal/noise) modulation and convolution 

Digital: digitalization(sampling, quantification), spectrum analysis, FTT, digital filtering. 
Technical application to sound and images (edge detection, erosion, labeling,...)
