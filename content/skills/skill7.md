###### Planning, execution, monitoring
Analysis of the business needs and the project requirements. Identification of the project scope. Analysis of available technical solution, work amount estimation and schedule creation.

Translation of the requirements in operationalizable tasks that will lead to completion. Prioritization and hierarchization of those tasks. 
 
Completion of selected tasks according to the project plan, in collaboration with co-workers using version control systems.   

Keep the team and management on the track of the project's progress.


###### Agile principles
Incremental and iterative approach to software design with minimal up-front planning.
 
On each iteration, cross-functional teams work in all functions (planning, analysis, design, coding, testing) and delivers the product to stakeholders to get their validation. Each iteration has its own testing phase, where the stakeholders have the opportunity to try the product and give feedback through its conception.
The value of the software is the main measure of the progress. 

This approach welcomes changing requirements, encourages collaboration and positive criticism, and aim to maximize the customer satisfaction.    

###### Scrum
A framework which help people address complex adaptive problems. Scrum is widely used by software development teams across the world.

It implements the scientific method of empiricism to software development. It addresses complexity by making information transparent so everyone can inspect current conditions and adapt their way of working in response.
The scrum methodology is defined by team roles (product owner, scrum master, dev team), events (sprint, sprint planning, daily stand-up, sprint review, retrospective) and artifacts (Product backlog, sprint backlog, increments).
