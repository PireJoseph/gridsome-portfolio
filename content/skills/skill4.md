Conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing and maintaining software.

###### Identification of needs

###### Planning
Extracting the requirements that belongs to the software from abstract features and business needs to specify the scope of the development.

###### Design
High level designing of the main modules of the software solution with a big picture of how the parts fits and interact together. 
Selection of the language, operating system, and hardware component involved.

###### Implementation
Coding the software itself according to the specification, the guidelines, and the coding style chosen.

###### Testing 
Ensuring that defects are minimized and recognized as soon as possible. Possibility of elaborating test before development in order to use those test as a guideline for the implementation's correctness (aka test-driven development)

###### Documenting
Description of the design of the software and its functionalities for the purpose of maintenance, communication, and enhancement.

###### Deployment
Delivery of each version of the software produced after having been validated by the test suite. Distribution into the production environment. 

###### Maintenance
Enhancement of the software by adding new features, refactoring the codebase, and fixing bugs following the given feedback and reported issues
